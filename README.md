# ProjectEuler
<h6>A repository of solutions of projecteuler.net problems.</h6>

The problems are listed as p<i> where p is just an alias for problem and i counts for problem Number.

All the codes are written in Languages C and Pyhton and can be used by Curious progrmmers to learn how to code.

All the algoriths applied have been made by me without concerning anywhere. Although they give true results and have been tested, they may not be the most efficient one.

All the programs will take a finite time not more than a maximum of a few minutes.
